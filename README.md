# Hi, I'm Richard Tichý,

Self-made software engineer, team leader and system designer from the Czech Republic and
a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at [Smíchov Technical High School](https://www.ssps.cz/).

I have been programming stuff already for 8 years, since 2014. During that time I have managed to get the knowledge of
many programming languages such as C, C#, Rust, Kotlin or Clojure, server technologies such as Redis, MySQL, MariaDB or
PostgreSQL and system stuff in the Linux world, as I daily drive Linux, as the main OS.
