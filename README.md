# Hi, I'm Richard Tich√Ω,

a software engineer, a team leader and a system designer from the Czech Republic.

I have used many programming languages such as C, C#, Rust, Kotlin or Clojure,
server technologies such as Redis, MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL and
 know system stuff in the Linux world, as I daily drive Linux, as the main OS.

## Projects

*As an example of my work, I can give you those few ones.*

### [Rusjure](https://github.com/rusjure/rusjure)

A compiler of a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)-like language, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Parsing is built using library [Pest](https://pest.rs/), which allowed me to define the syntax using
[PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) format.
Although in many languages the parsing part is quite complicated,
in [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))-like dialect I found the parsing quite simple.
I found more complicated though implementation of the [macros](https://clojure.org/reference/macros).
I had to understand that in Clojure, the code is *not translated*, but actually executed. Even a definition of
a function is a macro invocation.

### [Sportisimo Marks](https://github.com/artifycz/sportisimo-marks)

a partial duplicate of an internal system, written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Nette](https://nette.org/)

### [vavercak.cz](https://vavercak.cz/)

web-page of a carpenter

### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/ArtifyCZ/minesweeper)

a web implementation of game Minesweeper,
written in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with use of
[Asp.Net Boilerplate (ABP)](https://abp.io/) and
[Blazor Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-7.0)

### Mega-Hosting.eu

a Minecraft server hosting page (the shop and internal system),
written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Nette](https://nette.org/)

### CMS and framework

a custom CMS built upon a custom MVC framework, both written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
